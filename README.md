If you want to start playing click or press on start and the chess pieces should apear. After that remember that white moves first and keep in mind chess rules. 
A side note for when you hit start you need to enter a match like RnbkqbnR/PPPppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBKQBNR for it to show the pieces. If you want to start a default chess match just input rnbkqbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBKQBNR on the text box and click show text
